A library (bookstore) application in Java, which uses MySQL for a database, Hibernate framework for transactions with the database, and JavaFx, CSS and XML for the UI. The main functionalities are to create and manage user and admin accounts, borrow different types of resources (books, laptops, CDs) and draw profile images. The code is documented using JavaDoc. (Maven is required to compile) (some functionalities were removed for better testing purposes)
Docs folder contains group documents.
Src folder contains the code from a personal version of the project.
If you are using my DB provided you can login as Librarian, username: 1 , password passMe. If not, then you need to add at least one admin when you first create your DB.
